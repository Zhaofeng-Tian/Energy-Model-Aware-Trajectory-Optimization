# Constants
density_diesel_kg_per_L = 0.85  # kg/L
energy_content_diesel_MJ_per_L = 35.8  # MJ/L
MJ_to_kWh = 1 / 3.6  # Convert MJ to kWh (since 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ)

# Given fuel consumption
fuel_consumption_g_per_kWh = 200  # g/kWh

# Step 1: Convert g/kWh to kg/kWh
fuel_consumption_kg_per_kWh = fuel_consumption_g_per_kWh / 1000

# Step 2: Convert kg/kWh to L/kWh using the density of diesel
fuel_consumption_L_per_kWh = fuel_consumption_kg_per_kWh / density_diesel_kg_per_L

# Step 3: Convert L/kWh to L/s considering the energy content of diesel and the kWh to MJ conversion
# Note: This step involves understanding how many L are consumed per second at a constant power output of 1kW.
# Since the energy content is given per L and we have converted our consumption to L/kWh, 
# we can use the conversion factor directly to understand the L consumed per hour and then convert it to seconds.

# Conversion to L/s directly (since we assume a continuous output of 1 kW, 
# the time component in kWh cancels out with the hourly consumption rate)
fuel_consumption_L_per_s = fuel_consumption_L_per_kWh / 3600  # Convert from per hour to per second

# Convert L/s to ml/s
fuel_consumption_ml_per_s = fuel_consumption_L_per_s * 1000  # 1 L = 1000 ml

print(fuel_consumption_ml_per_s)
